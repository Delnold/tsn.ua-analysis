### Overview
Welcome to the tsn.ua Analysis project! This project aims to automate data extraction from tsn.ua, export it into an SQL database, create SQL queries for data analysis, and visualize the results using appropriate tools. By doing so, we seek to gain insights and valuable information from the content on tsn.ua.

### Project Goals
1. **Automate Data Extraction**: The Primary goal is to automate the process of extracting data from tsn.ua. Planning to use tsn.ua API which was discovered through their "More News" button.
2. **Data Storage**: Structuring and storing the extracted data in an SQL database. This will involve designing an appropriate database schema or data models for efficient data storage and retrieval.

3. **Analytical Queries**: Creating a set of SQL queries to perform data analysis. This includes extracting meaningful insights, trends, or patterns from the collected data.

4. **Data Visualization**: To make the results more accessible and informative, I plan to visualize the data using visualization libraries or tools.
